We will start the mainnet node infrastructure with running the recommended settings from Tron Foundation. Since we are on startup mode and our small team is paying for this system out of our own personal funds to run for Super Representative and also support the Tron mainnet ecosystem launch. Our expected budget for this is $60,000 USD annually.

We will be running the following system configuration:

Server Location and Placement: 
United States East Region (West Virginia)

System Configuration: 
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
EC2 Type: AWS x1.16xlarge
CPU: 64 cores
RAM: 1T
SSD: 20T(EBS)
Network Bandwidth: 25Gbps
 
Once we are successfully voted to one of the Tron Super Representatives with your help and the additional funds raised from the TRX generation we will reinvest the bulk of these funds back into upgrading our systems to further enhance the Tron mainnet by adding the following: 
(***all nodes will be EC2 Type: AWS x1.16xlarge)

Expected Budget: $180,000.00 USD per Year
QTY: 2 EC2 nodes for Mainnet Witness Nodes
QTY: 1 EC2 node for Mainnet Solidity Nodes
