**TronSpark Community Plan**

Tron has been able to overcome adversity thanks to its determined and loyal following. “It is the community that will take Tron to the next level and beyond.” (You may want to put a Twitter share on this comment by TronSpark) With the help of the community, TronSpark hopes to be a big part in Tron’s evolution. 

TronSpark firmly believes that for our efforts to materialize, it is of utmost importance to earn the trust and respect of the community. In order to accomplish this, we will have many channels to interact with the team so that ideas and concerns can be discussed. Our staff will always be open to discussing new ideas. After all, that’s how ideas come to life.

**How will TronSpark make a difference?**

As with any business, marketing is an integral part of growth. TronSpark aims to be the spark that will propagate, via the community’s help, into the marketing arm of the Tron movement. We count on every Tron enthusiast being a part of this marketing effort. In essense, TronSpark will provide our community with professional digital content, both in video and text format, so that the community can present this information and news to the world via their social channels. It is our common goal, both for TronSpark and the community, to educate and inform individuals of the exciting future that Tron promises to deliver. In our future fund distribution plan, we will reward our community for content sharing and distribution. We feel that hard work should be rewarded. We also feel that this is the best way that we can help Tron reach its goals.

TronSpark would also like to work with other Super Representatives, or candidates, to organize events that are in the best interest of the Tron platform. We will produce content as requested by any Super Representative. It is important to work together as we all share a common goal. 

**Social Events**
We are grateful for the support from the community as we will work together to organize Tron focused social meets -

Please always remember that getting any rewards on a token that is losing value, is not our objective. Our mission is to help the Tron ecosystem grow, thereby, delivering value to ALL TRX holders.
